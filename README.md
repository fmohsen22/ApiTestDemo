# ApiTestDemo
This is just a small API Test Demo I made based on REST API at http://postcodes.io

Details:
•	Console output.
•	Application  accept a postcode as an argument to its main() method, and based on the need of user make the following processes:
	1-Validate the postcode parameter – invalid postcodes produce an error message
	2-Print the country and region for that postcode.
	3-Print a list of the nearest postcodes, and their countries and regions.
	
Also there is an small suit test made to test the different functionalities of this App.
